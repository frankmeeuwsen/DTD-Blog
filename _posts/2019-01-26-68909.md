My 2 cents to this blogpost from Jack, mentioning M.G. Siegler about Miro.blog being too spartan for a linkblog: What made Tumblr so great to use where the bookmarklet and possibilities to include all sorts of content in an easy and intuitive way. Micro.blog and other blogclients are not there yet. We need Micropublish clients that are consumer-first in both design, ease of use and possibilities. Now most bookmarklets and clients are too technical to understand for any average Tumblr-user. 
We need more diversity in blogclients, based on open and decentralized protocols. More linkblogs, more interoperability. More of this!
