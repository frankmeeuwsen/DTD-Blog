I breath a sigh of relief when I come across pages like [Hrefhunt](https://www.kickscondor.com/hrefhunt/). Those curated, handmade, well-thought little explorations and collections of personal websites. Free of any businessmodel, Producthunt-format or growthhack-tactics. They bring a certain kind of slowness and ease back in the web that I lost for quite some time. Make sure you check out the rest of Kicks Condor&#39;s website. As the byline goes there: Leeching and linking in the hypertext kingdom. Digging it!
