Jack Baty op [Facebook vs The Open Web][1]: most people don’t care about all this open web nonsense. They just want to find and interact with their friends. I agree with him.
Colin Walker op [Why we need short form content on our blogs][2]: It was far easier to throw out a tweet, a dozen, a hundred, and still feel productive with minimal effort.
Manton Reece op [Decline and return of indie blogs][3]: By taking microblogging back from Twitter, we create a natural place for traditional blogs to grow. Indie microblogging is the gateway drug for long-form content.
Jeffrey Zeldman op [New A List Apart wants you!][4]:Help the open web stay open. Help us build the future
Colin Walker op [deze titelloze post][5]: The sad thing is that most don't care about the open web or about content longevity. Ephemera has taken over because most aren't creating anything that needs to be retained beyond the context of the current conversation.
