&quot;Coding Is An Art

I consider coding an art. I really do. Good coders are cool people and coders who aren&#39;t good shouldn&#39;t be paid to code. Good coders are not as popular nor important today that I&#39;d like them to be. Quality code is usually a forgotten issue in the huge corporate developing of today. All people are thought to do equally good. I wish people one day will realize that some people do better code, some do worse code. I&#39;ll become more appreciated that day.

You simply aren&#39;t a skilled programmer after a few years in college. You need time and time in front of a computer bent over a keyboard. You need hundreds of hard hours hacking. &quot;
