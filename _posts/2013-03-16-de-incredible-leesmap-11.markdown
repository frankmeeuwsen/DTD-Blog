# De Incredible Leesmap #11





Ondanks het verdwijnen van Google Reader blijf ik lekker gebruik maken van zowel RSS als sociale signalen voor interessante artikelen die ik in het weekend met jullie deel. Hier is editie 11 al weer van de leesmap. Veel leesplezier!







  * [Punk Rock Is Bullshit](http://www.seattleweekly.com/2013-03-06/music/punk-rock-is-bullshit/full/)-Ultimately, punk rock was a disease of the soul, a doctrine of projecting and amplifying feelings of insecurity and fear outward and inward until the whole world seemed like an ice cave


  * [Cloud Shield, Twine's Gateway To The Full-Blown Internet Of Things](http://www.fastcodesign.com/1672036/cloud-shield-twines-gateway-to-the-full-blown-internet-of-things)-Twine is so idiot-proof that within 30 minutes of unboxing it, I had set it up to enable my washing machine to send me a text message when the laundry was done


  * [Doing that one thing — Tech News and Analysis](http://gigaom.com/2013/03/06/doing-that-one-thing/) - Thirty-five years later, I still do it because I don’t really have a choice, because I don’t really know any other way. Writing, painting, creating –creators don’t do it because they want to make money. Creativity is not a profession, it is a gift. It was, is and always will be a very selfish act.


  * [Facebook maakt jacht op tieners](http://pfauth.com/nieuwe-media/facebook-en-de-jacht-op-de-tieners/) - …zoals je ouders vroeger niet je schoolagenda mochten inkijken, begeven tieners zich op netwerken waar volwassenen hen niet weten te vinden.


  * [LinkedIn Aims to Become Premier Hub for Content Marketing](http://contently.com/blog/2013/03/11/linkedin-aims-to-become-premier-hub-for-content-marketing/) - LinkedIn wants to become the first place professionals come to both distribute branded content and consume content that will help them do their job better.


  * [Why Medium Might Be Large](http://www.chrisbrogan.com/medium/) – Should Medium replace your blog? No. Nay. Never. Nothing will. Sorry folks who’ve fled to Google+. That’s like renting a hotel room, putting up your Zeppelin posters and thinking you’re home.


  * [Missing the Subway](http://inoveryourhead.net/missing-the-subway/) - People always talk about “missing the boat,” but I think differently. I think of opportunity as a series of subways, running through a station, one after the other.


  * [The paradigm shift that will enable you to create more content and just be you](http://alphaefficiency.com/the-paradigm-shift-that-will-enable-you-to-create-more-content-and-just-be-you/) - The only way you can actually see my productivity, is if I produce. So I will be out there, in the gutter, pushing word by word, and making it happen. Word by word.


  * [A Book Is a Start-up](http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/books/2013/03/leanpub-netminds-web-publishing.html) – “A book is a startup,” declared Peter Armstrong in a speech about his serialized book company, Leanpub. “I said it in 2010, and I’ll say it again.”


  * [Why RSS still matters](http://www.theverge.com/2013/3/14/4105006/why-rss-still-matters) – Yes, I'm fully aware that writing that I love a web standard and that it has enriched my life makes me sound awfully nerdy. Whatever: open web standards have enriched your life too, and in fact that's the first of several reasons why I deeply disagree with the argument that Twitter can replace RSS.
