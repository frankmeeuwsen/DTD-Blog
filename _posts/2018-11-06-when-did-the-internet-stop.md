[There really aren’t any rules for the web](https://electricabacus.net/2015/09/01/when-did-the-internet-stop-being-a-work-of-art/) so why does everything feel so consistent and homogeneous? Where are the people doing things their own way. It doesn’t feel like anyone is figuring anything out anymore. Where are all the experiments? Where are my art projects?
